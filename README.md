# node-police-data example

This example aims to be a simple skeleton project for a node application to display information from an open data source on a map. The aims of this project are to teach the concepts of:

- Node.js
- EJS views
- Page routes
- PUT/GET requests
- Static HTML serving (js/css/html/whatever else)
- Access to an open data source
- Usage of leaflet
- NPM and Bower
- Bootstrap (possibly)

## Current status

- Skeleton project implemented
- Express set up
- NPM and Bower instaled and initialised
- Added to Github
- Gitignore set up
- Leaflet added to map div
- Routes and views set up
- Static serve folder added

## TODO

- Add in open data source
- Add GET request for open data to node app
- Combine with Bootstrap (maybe)
