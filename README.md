# node-police-data example

This example aims to be a simple skeleton project for a node application to display information from an open data source on a map. The aims of this project are to teach the concepts of:

- Node.js
- EJS views
- Page routes
- PUT/GET requests
- Static HTML serving (js/css/html/whatever else)
- Access to an open data source
- Usage of leaflet
- NPM and Bower
- Bootstrap (possibly)

I would strongly recommend looking through some sample pages at the following links to understand the frameworks I use to make YOUR life easier. You don't have to understand all of this but any knowledge absorbed could be useful.

https://nodejs.org
http://nodeschool.io/
http://www.w3schools.com
http://leafletjs.com
http://getbootstrap.com
http://bower.io
https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm


The core techonlogies we use are:
- Node.JS
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bower
- Leaflet.js
- Bootstrap

Please try to at least have a play around with HTML, CSS and Javascript as these are the building blocks of everything web, think of them as the foundations. 

At the ABSOLUTE least, try to do the following two tutorials first.

This project uses the UK police data source to plot crimes on a map.

If you have any questions prior to YRS 2015 please email me on tm0797@my.bristol.ac.uk.

I love helping out so please feel free to send me any questions. If something isn't clear for you, it's likely others have similar questions.

I will try my best to help you understand the code and run this example on your own machine, that being said I am fairly busy but will try to get back to you in 2-3 days.
